### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome

Im a data enthusiast with experience in Looker studio, data pipeline development, and data science-related projects. My work in Looker studio has been featured in a video demonstration, and I have created a data pipeline for Adsense.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Odoo, Server-side Tracking, A-B testing

In my GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of data science projects, including a comparison of ML models between linear regression and neural networks, sentimental analysis, and an automation project. I am also currently learning about Odoo and server-side tracking.

### Projects I'm happy to share âœ¨ 
- [ML Model Performance Comparison](https://github.com/tonmoyazad/Data-Science/blob/main/car.ipynb)- Compare the performance between Linear Regression & Neaural Network models with car prices!

- [Sentimental Analysis]( https://github.com/tonmoyazad/Data-Science/blob/main/reviews.ipynb) - Compare the performance between Linear Regression & Neaural Network models with car prices!


- [Adsense Data Pipeline with GCP](https://github.com/tonmoyazad/adsense_data_pipeline) - Pull Adsense Data using with the help of Google Cloud, Adsense Management API and storing it Google Sheets. 

- [Looker Studio Dashboards](https://youtu.be/NNQTKegTVgc, )



Outside of my work in data, I enjoy cycling and exploring new trails. Please feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile to learn more about my background and experience.

Thanks for stopping by!
